                    <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/" target="_blanck"> HufflePuff</a>
                    is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch
                    Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among
                    the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience,
                    loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in
                    its members. The emblematic animal is a badger, and yellow
                    and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona
                    Sprout and the Fat Friar is the House's patron ghost.Hufflepuff
                    corresponds roughly to the element of earth,and it is for that
                    reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented
                    wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.The Hufflepuff point
                    hourglass contains yellow diamonds. Students sorted into
                    Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology,
                    owing to their correspondence to earth.
